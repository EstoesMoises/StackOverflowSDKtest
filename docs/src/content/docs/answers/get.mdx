  console.log(`Last edited: ${answer.lastEditDate}`);
  console.log(`Edited by: ${answer.lastEditor?.displayName}`);
}
```

### Team Context

// Using team context
const teamSDK = sdk.forTeam('team-123');
const teamAnswer = await teamSDK.answers.get(123, 456);

// Or with direct client initialization
import { AnswerClient } from 'so-teams-sdk';
const teamAnswerClient = new AnswerClient(config, 'team-123');

## Notes

- This method returns the complete answer object with all available fields, unlike `getAll()` which returns summary objects
- Both HTML and Markdown versions of the content are available in the response
- User-specific fields like `isBookmarked` and `isFollowed` reflect the state for the authenticated user
- Deleted answers may still be retrievable depending on permissions, but will have `isDeleted: true`
