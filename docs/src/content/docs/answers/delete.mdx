Deletes an answer permanently or marks it as deleted, depending on permissions and answer status.

## Syntax

```typescript
async delete(questionId: number, answerId: number): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `questionId` | `number` | Yes | The unique identifier of the question that contains the answer |
| `answerId` | `number` | Yes | The unique identifier of the answer to delete |

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise<void>`. The method completes successfully if the deletion was processed, regardless of whether it was a soft delete (marked as deleted) or hard delete (permanently removed).

## Examples

### Basic Answer Deletion

```typescript
import StackOverflowSDK from 'stack-overflow-sdk';

const sdk = new StackOverflowSDK({
  accessToken: 'your-access-token',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.stackoverflowteams.com'
});

// Delete an answer
await sdk.answers.delete(123, 456);
console.log('Answer deleted successfully');
```

### Delete with Confirmation

```typescript
async function deleteAnswerWithConfirmation(questionId: number, answerId: number) {
  try {
    // Get answer details first
    const answer = await sdk.answers.get(questionId, answerId);
    
    console.log(`About to delete answer: "${answer.body.substring(0, 50)}..."`);
    console.log(`Created by: ${answer.owner?.displayName}`);
    console.log(`Score: ${answer.score}`);
    
    // Confirm deletion (in a real app, you'd show a dialog)
    const confirmed = true; // Replace with actual confirmation logic
    
    if (confirmed) {
      await sdk.answers.delete(questionId, answerId);
      console.log('Answer has been deleted');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete answer:', error.message);
  }
}

await deleteAnswerWithConfirmation(123, 456);
```

### Bulk Deletion (with Error Handling)

```typescript
async function deleteMultipleAnswers(questionId: number, answerIds: number[]) {
  const results = [];
  
  for (const answerId of answerIds) {
    try {
      await sdk.answers.delete(questionId, answerId);
      results.push({ answerId, status: 'deleted' });
      console.log(`Deleted answer ${answerId}`);
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({ answerId, status: 'failed', error: error.message });
      console.error(`Failed to delete answer ${answerId}:`, error.message);
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}

const deletionResults = await deleteMultipleAnswers(123, [456, 789, 101]);
console.log('Deletion results:', deletionResults);
```

### Team Context

```typescript
// Using team context
const teamSDK = sdk.forTeam('team-123');
await teamSDK.answers.delete(123, 456);

// Or with direct client initialization
import { AnswerClient } from 'stack-overflow-sdk';
const teamAnswerClient = new AnswerClient(config, 'team-123');
await teamAnswerClient.delete(123, 456);
```

## Error Handling

This method can throw the following errors:

| Error Type | Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `AuthenticationError` | 401 | Invalid or missing authentication token |
| `TokenExpiredError` | 401 | Authentication token has expired |
| `ForbiddenError` | 403 | Insufficient permissions to delete this answer |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | Question or answer with the specified ID does not exist |
| `SDKError` | Various | Other API or network errors |

### Example Error Handling

```typescript
import StackOverflowSDK, { NotFoundError, ForbiddenError } from 'stack-overflow-sdk';

const sdk = new StackOverflowSDK({
  accessToken: 'your-access-token',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.stackoverflowteams.com'
});

try {
  await sdk.answers.delete(123, 456);
  console.log('Answer deleted successfully');
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.error('Answer not found - may already be deleted');
  } else if (error instanceof ForbiddenError) {
    console.error('Cannot delete this answer - insufficient permissions');
  } else {
    console.error('Failed to delete answer:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Permission Scenarios

```typescript
async function safeDeleteAnswer(questionId: number, answerId: number) {
  try {
    await sdk.answers.delete(questionId, answerId);
    return { success: true, message: 'Answer deleted' };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ForbiddenError) {
      // Common reasons for deletion restrictions:
      // - Not the answer owner
      // - Answer is accepted (may require special permissions)
      // - Answer has upvotes (may require confirmation)
      // - Insufficient reputation for deletion
      return { 
        success: false, 
        reason: 'permissions', 
        message: 'You do not have permission to delete this answer' 
      };
    } else if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
      return { 
        success: false, 
        reason: 'not_found', 
        message: 'Answer not found or already deleted' 
      };
    } else {
      return { 
        success: false, 
        reason: 'error', 
        message: error.message 
      };
    }
  }
}

const result = await safeDeleteAnswer(123, 456);
console.log(result);
```

## Notes

- Only the answer owner or users with sufficient privileges (moderators) can delete answers
- Deletion behavior depends on the answer's status and score:
  - Low-score answers by the owner may be permanently deleted
  - High-score or accepted answers are typically soft-deleted (marked as deleted but preserved)
  - Moderators can perform both soft and hard deletions
- Deleted answers may still be visible to users with sufficient reputation
- The deletion may be reversible (undeletable) depending on the platform's rules and user permissions
- Accepted answers may require additional confirmation or permissions to delete
- The method automatically handles both public and team contexts based on how the client was initialized
- After successful deletion, subsequent calls to `get()` for the same answer will throw a `NotFoundError`
- Some answers may be protected from deletion due to community guidelines or historical significance
