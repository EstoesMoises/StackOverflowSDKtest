title: Secure API Token Generation with OAuth and PKCE
description: Learn how to authenticate with our API using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and SDK integration.
---
This guide shows you how to authenticate with the Stack Overflow for Teams API using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). PKCE is a security extension that makes OAuth flows safe for public clients like web apps and mobile applications.

The authentication process involves two main steps:
1. **Authorization**: Redirect users to authorize your app and receive a temporary code
2. **Token Exchange**: Exchange the code for an access token using PKCE verification

Our SDK handles all the PKCE complexity automatically, including generating code verifiers, creating challenges, and managing the secure token exchange.

## Authenticating with the SDK

Integrate OAuth 2.0 with PKCE authentication:

```ts title="Authenticate.ts"
import { StackOverflowTeams } from '@stackoverflow/teams-sdk';

const client = new StackOverflowTeams({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-site.stackoverflowteams.com',
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  redirectUri: 'https://your-app.com/callback'
});

// Redirect user to log in and authorize
const authUrl = client.getAuthorizationUrl(['read_inbox', 'write_access']);
window.location.href = authUrl;

// After redirect back, exchange code for access token
const token = await client.exchangeCodeForToken('authorization-code');
console.log('Access token:', token.access_token);
```

---

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you call `getAuthorizationUrl()`:

* The SDK generates a random **code verifier**
* It creates a **code challenge** by hashing the verifier (using `S256`)
* It builds the authorization URL with your `clientId`, `redirectUri`, `scope`, `code_challenge`, and `code_challenge_method=S256`
* The browser navigates to that URL for the user to log in and approve access

After the user authorizes:

* The server redirects to your `redirectUri` with a temporary `code`
* You call `exchangeCodeForToken()` with the `code` and the original **code verifier**
* The SDK sends a secure token request to the API, swapping the `code` for an **access token**

> PKCE ensures this flow can't be intercepted or abused by malicious apps, even without a client secret.

## Required SDK Config Options

| Option          | Description                           | Required |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `baseUrl`       | Your Teams site URL                   | ✅        |
| `clientId`      | OAuth application Client ID           | ✅        |
| `redirectUri`   | Redirect URI registered with your app | ✅        |
| `timeout`       | Request timeout in seconds            | optional |
| `retryAttempts` | Retry attempts on failure             | optional |

---

## API Scopes

Pass scopes as an array of strings to control what your app can access:

```typescript
client.getAuthorizationUrl(['read_inbox', 'write_access'])
```

| Scope          | Description                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `read_inbox`   | Read user's global inbox               |
| `write_access` | Write on behalf of the user            |
| `no_expiry`    | Token never expires *(use cautiously)* |

## Best Practices

* PKCE is always enforced
* Store tokens securely (never in plain localStorage)
* Request minimal scopes
* Validate the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF
* Use HTTPS for all OAuth requests
