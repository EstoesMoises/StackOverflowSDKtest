# Wrapper Update Guide

**Generated:** 2025-09-30T18:11:29.076Z
**Risk Level:** `LOW`

## üìã Summary

The SDK has been updated with new user analytics functionality. A new model `UserAnalyticsResponseModel` was added, and significant changes were made to the Users APIs (both Main and Teams variants) with approximately 5,400 bytes of new code. The Questions API also received substantial updates with about 6,800 bytes of new functionality. These changes appear to add analytics and reporting capabilities to the user management system.

## üîÑ Migration Steps

1. 1. Review the generated APIs (UsersMainApi, UsersTeamsApi, QuestionsMainApi) to identify the specific new methods that were added
2. 2. Update users.ts to add analytics-related methods, starting with getUserAnalytics() and getCurrentUserAnalytics()
3. 3. Update questions.ts to add any new question-related functionality discovered in step 1
4. 4. Update shared/types.ts to export UserAnalyticsResponseModel for easier access
5. 5. Test existing functionality to ensure no regressions were introduced
6. 6. Test new analytics endpoints to verify they work correctly
7. 7. Update documentation to reflect new analytics capabilities

## üìù Files to Update

### üü† MODIFY: `src/client/users.ts`

**Priority:** HIGH

**Why:** The UsersMainApi and UsersTeamsApi received significant updates (~5,400-5,800 bytes each), indicating new analytics functionality that should be exposed through the wrapper.

**Instructions:**
Add new analytics methods to the UserClient class. Based on the API changes, there are likely new endpoints for retrieving user analytics data. Add methods like getUserAnalytics() that return UserAnalyticsResponseModel.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Add to UserClient class

/**
 * Retrieves analytics data for a specific user
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user
 * @returns Promise<UserAnalyticsResponseModel> - User analytics data
 */
async getUserAnalytics(userId: number): Promise<UserAnalyticsResponseModel> {
  return this.handleApiCall(async () => {
    if (this.teamId && this.teamsApi) {
      return await this.teamsApi.teamsTeamUsersUserIdAnalyticsGet(userId, this.teamId);
    }
    
    return await this.mainApi.usersUserIdAnalyticsGet(userId);
  }, 'getUserAnalytics');
}

/**
 * Retrieves analytics data for the current authenticated user
 * @returns Promise<UserAnalyticsResponseModel> - Current user's analytics data
 */
async getCurrentUserAnalytics(): Promise<UserAnalyticsResponseModel> {
  const currentUser = await this.getCurrentUser();
  if (!currentUser.id) {
    throw new Error('Current user ID not available');
  }
  return this.getUserAnalytics(currentUser.id);
}
```

### üü° MODIFY: `src/client/questions.ts`

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why:** QuestionsMainApi received substantial updates (+6,841 bytes), indicating new functionality that should be wrapped for easier consumption.

**Instructions:**
Review and add any new question-related functionality that was added to QuestionsMainApi. The 6,800+ bytes of changes suggest new endpoints or enhanced existing ones. Look for new methods in the generated API and add corresponding wrapper methods.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Example pattern for new question functionality
// (Actual methods depend on what was added to the API)

/**
 * New question functionality - example pattern
 * @param questionId - The unique identifier of the question
 * @param options - Additional options for the operation
 * @returns Promise with appropriate response type
 */
async newQuestionMethod(questionId: number, options?: SomeOptionsType): Promise<SomeResponseType> {
  return this.handleApiCall(async () => {
    if (this.teamId && this.teamsApi) {
      return await this.teamsApi.newTeamMethod(questionId, this.teamId, options);
    }
    
    return await this.mainApi.newMainMethod(questionId, options);
  }, 'newQuestionMethod');
}
```

### üü¢ MODIFY: `src/client/shared/types.ts`

**Priority:** LOW

**Why:** New model should be available through the shared types for better developer experience.

**Instructions:**
Add import and re-export for UserAnalyticsResponseModel if it should be available as a shared type. This makes the new analytics model easily accessible to consumers of the wrapper.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Add to existing exports
export { UserAnalyticsResponseModel } from '../../generated/models/UserAnalyticsResponseModel.js';

// Or if creating a new analytics-specific interface:
export interface UserAnalytics {
  // Define common analytics properties that might be useful
  // This would wrap or extend UserAnalyticsResponseModel
}
```

---

### üü¢ REVIEW: `src/client/index.ts`

**Priority:** LOW

**Why:** Main entry point should expose new functionality for easy consumption.

**Instructions:**
Review the main index.ts file to ensure any new types or models are properly exported. The generated index.ts had minor changes (-62 bytes), so verify that UserAnalyticsResponseModel and any other new types are accessible to consumers.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Ensure these exports exist or add them:
export { UserAnalyticsResponseModel } from './generated/models/UserAnalyticsResponseModel.js';

// In the main StackOverflowSDK class, no changes needed unless new client types were added
```

## ‚ú® New Endpoints to Wrap

### GET User Analytics

**Generated SDK:** `apis/UsersMainApi`
**Wrapper file:** `src/client/users.ts`
**Suggested method:** `getUserAnalytics`

**Example implementation:**
```typescript
async getUserAnalytics(userId: number): Promise<UserAnalyticsResponseModel> {
  return this.handleApiCall(async () => {
    if (this.teamId && this.teamsApi) {
      return await this.teamsApi.teamsTeamUsersUserIdAnalyticsGet(userId, this.teamId);
    }
    return await this.mainApi.usersUserIdAnalyticsGet(userId);
  }, 'getUserAnalytics');
}
```

---

### VARIOUS Enhanced Question Operations

**Generated SDK:** `apis/QuestionsMainApi`
**Wrapper file:** `src/client/questions.ts`
**Suggested method:** `variousNewMethods`

**Example implementation:**
```typescript
// Pattern for new question methods:
async newQuestionFeature(questionId: number, params?: any): Promise<any> {
  return this.handleApiCall(async () => {
    if (this.teamId && this.teamsApi) {
      return await this.teamsApi.newTeamMethod(questionId, this.teamId, params);
    }
    return await this.mainApi.newMainMethod(questionId, params);
  }, 'newQuestionFeature');
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Notes

- All existing wrapper methods should continue to work without changes
- New functionality is additive and can be adopted incrementally
- UserAnalyticsResponseModel is a new type that extends the type system without breaking existing code
- The pattern of dual API support (Main/Teams) should be maintained for new methods

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test all existing user-related operations (getAll, get, getCurrentUser, getByEmail, etc.) to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Test all existing question-related operations (getAll, get, ask, update, delete, voting, etc.) to ensure no regressions
- [ ] If implementing new analytics functionality, test getUserAnalytics() with valid user IDs
- [ ] Test getCurrentUserAnalytics() with authenticated users
- [ ] Verify that UserAnalyticsResponseModel is properly typed and accessible
- [ ] Test both main API and teams API variants of new functionality
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly for new endpoints
- [ ] Test pagination and filtering on any new list endpoints that may have been added
- [ ] Validate that new functionality follows the same patterns as existing wrapper methods
- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation to ensure all new types are properly integrated
